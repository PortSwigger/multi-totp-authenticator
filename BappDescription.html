<p>
    This extension manages multiple time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) simultaneously, enabling security testing of
    applications that protect different endpoints or accounts with separate multi-factor authentication tokens. Each
    TOTP can be configured independently and automatically inserted into requests based on customizable match patterns.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Manage unlimited TOTP tokens within a single project, each with independent configuration and match patterns
    </li>
    <li>Automatically refreshed codes displayed in a dedicated tab with visual countdown timers for each token</li>
    <li>Individual enable/disable controls for each TOTP to activate only the tokens needed for current testing</li>
    <li>Automatic insertion of TOTPs into requests using configurable match strings or regular expressions per token
    </li>
    <li>QR code scanning support for adding TOTPs without manual secret entry</li>
    <li>Integration with Scanner for authenticated crawling of sites requiring two-factor authentication across multiple
        accounts</li>
    <li>Session handling rule support for precise scope control over TOTP replacement</li>
    <li>Customizable TOTP parameters per token including duration, code length, and hashing algorithm (SHA-1, SHA-256,
        SHA-512)</li>
    <li>Context menu integration for selecting which token to insert into message editors</li>
    <li>Project file persistence for all TOTP configurations across sessions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the TOTP tab and add a code by entering a name, Base 32-encoded secret, and optional parameters
        (duration, code length, algorithm), or use the Scan QR or Paste QR buttons to populate fields automatically from
        a QR code</li>
    <li>Configure the match string that will be replaced with the TOTP code in requests, optionally enabling regular
        expression matching in the extension settings under Extensions &rarr; TOTP</li>
    <li>Set your scope by clicking the scope configuration button to define which tools and URLs should have TOTP
        replacement enabled</li>
    <li>Enable the "Replace in requests?" checkbox for the TOTP to activate automatic replacement</li>
    <li>Use the extension with Scanner by recording a login sequence, editing the TOTP input event to use your
        configured placeholder, and verifying replacement in the Logger tab</li>
    <li>Alternatively, use session handling rules by adding "Invoke a Burp extension" &rarr; "Insert TOTP into request"
        to gain fine-grained control over when replacement occurs</li>
    <li>Manually insert current codes or placeholders into any message editor by right-clicking and selecting Extensions
        &rarr; TOTP &rarr; Insert code or Insert placeholder</li>
</ol>
